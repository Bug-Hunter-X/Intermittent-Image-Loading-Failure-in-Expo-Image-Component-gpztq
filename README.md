## Intermittent Image Loading Failure in Expo Image Component

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while using Expo's `Image` component.  The image fails to load intermittently, even with a valid image URL. This issue is inconsistent across devices and app restarts. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic implementation, and `bugSolution.js` offers a potential solution involving caching and error handling.

**Problem:**
The `Image` component sometimes fails to display images, even though the URL is correct.  This results in a broken image icon or a blank space where the image should be.

**Solution:**
The solution involves implementing image caching using a library like `react-native-fast-image` to improve loading times and reduce network requests.  It also enhances error handling to display a placeholder or alternative image when loading fails. This provides a more robust user experience.
